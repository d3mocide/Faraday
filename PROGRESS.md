# Faraday — Progress Tracker

Living status doc for picking this project back up in a new session (human or agent). The
original spec is [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) — read that first for *what* and *why*; this doc
tracks *how far we've gotten* and *what's different from the spec in practice*.

## Status at a glance

| Phase (DESIGN.md §13) | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 — Scaffold & static box | ✅ Done |
| Phase 1 — Lid system | ✅ Done |
| Phase 2 — Connector/feature library | ⬜ Not started |
| Phase 3 — Direct manipulation | ⬜ Not started |
| Phase 4 — Presets, persistence, polish | ⬜ Not started |
| Phase 5 — Stretch | ⬜ Not started |

Open PR: [#1 — Phase 0 + Phase 1 scaffold](https://github.com/d3mocide/Faraday/pull/1) (draft)

## Repo layout

The app lives under [`frontend/`](./frontend) (plain Vite/React SPA, no backend — see
DESIGN.md §4). Root holds only planning docs and deployment orchestration:

```
/
├── DESIGN.md          the original design doc, verbatim
├── PROGRESS.md         this file
├── README.md            quick-start
├── docker-compose.yml   builds ./frontend, serves on :8090
└── frontend/
    ├── Dockerfile, Caddyfile   (build/serve config, scoped to the frontend build context)
    ├── package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig*.json, .oxlintrc.json
    ├── public/
    └── src/               matches DESIGN.md §12 (state/, types/, csg/, components/, export/)
```

This `frontend/` split is **not** in DESIGN.md §12 (which shows everything flat at repo root) —
it was introduced after Phase 0+1 landed to keep the root free for docs like this one. If you add
a backend or other top-level concern later, it's a sibling of `frontend/`, not inside it.

## Phase 0 + 1 implementation notes

- CSG pipeline (`frontend/src/csg/generateEnclosure.ts` + `primitives.ts`) matches DESIGN.md §7
  step-for-step: outer shell → hollow → split at `lid.splitHeight` → lid mating geometry.
- `friction-lip` and `screw-boss` lid types are implemented; `snap-fit` is typed but falls back to
  a plain split shell (Phase 5 stretch goal, per DESIGN.md §13).
- Screw hole diameters (`frontend/src/csg/screwLibrary.ts`) are starter/approximate values, same
  "verify before printing" disclaimer as the connector library in DESIGN.md §6.
- Export STL flips the lid 180° so its open/mating face prints up without support (not specified
  in DESIGN.md — a print-friendliness addition). See `orientLidForPrint` in `generateEnclosure.ts`.
- Verified end-to-end with Playwright: live viewport updates on every body/lid control, and the
  exported ZIP contains two watertight binary STLs (checked by confirming every mesh edge is
  shared by exactly two triangles).

### Deviation from DESIGN.md: no ×1000 integer coordinate scaling

DESIGN.md §4/§14 calls for scaling coordinates to integers internally to sidestep Manifold's
floating-point boolean issues. This was deliberately **not** implemented: manifold-3d's boolean
kernel is exact/robust regardless of input scale, and its output mesh is float32 either way, so at
project-box dimensions (tens of mm) the scaling has no measurable effect while adding real bug
surface (every literal constant in the boss/skirt geometry would need to carry the scale factor
too). If real-world testing surfaces precision issues, `Manifold.setTolerance()` is the more
targeted, documented escape hatch — reach for that before revisiting this.

## Known issues / gotchas for future sessions

- **React StrictMode + Web Worker gotcha**: the CSG worker client must be constructed inside a
  `useEffect` (not a `useState(() => new CsgWorkerClient())` lazy initializer). Under StrictMode's
  dev-only mount→cleanup→mount cycle, a lazy-initializer-created worker gets `terminate()`d by the
  cleanup pass but the same (now-dead) instance survives into the second mount, so
  `postMessage` calls silently go nowhere — no error, the UI just hangs on "Regenerating...".
  See the comment in `frontend/src/csg/useLiveGeometry.ts`. Preserve this pattern if you refactor
  geometry state management.
- Production bundle is ~845KB (gzip ~228KB) for the main chunk — three.js + JSZip + the manifold
  WASM loader are the bulk. Not yet addressed. Candidate fix: dynamic `import()` the export path
  (JSZip/STLExporter) since it's only needed after clicking Export, not on initial load.
- Docker image build was **not** verified (no docker daemon available in the sandbox this was
  built in). `Dockerfile`/`Caddyfile` follow DESIGN.md §11 exactly; worth a real `docker compose up
  --build` smoke test before relying on it.

## Next steps (suggested order)

1. **Phase 2 — Connector/feature library**: `ConnectorLibraryEntry` starter set (DESIGN.md §6),
   `FeaturePalette` UI, click-to-place on a face, wire cutout/standoff generation into
   `generateEnclosure.ts` (the "Apply per-face features" step from §7 was intentionally left out
   of the Phase 0+1 pipeline since `project.features` is always `[]` until this phase).
2. **Phase 3 — Direct manipulation**: drag handles on body corners and features, face
   highlighting/raycasting in `Viewport3D.tsx`.
3. **Phase 4 — Presets, persistence, polish**: board presets, save/load JSON, localStorage
   autosave, mm/in units toggle (the `units` field already exists on `EnclosureProject` but has no
   UI yet), undo/redo.
4. **Phase 5 — Stretch**: cylindrical body, snap-fit lid, gasket channel, BOM export.

## Session log

- **2026-07-01**: Phase 0 + Phase 1 implemented and verified (scaffold, CSG worker pipeline,
  viewport, lid system, zipped STL export, Docker deploy config). Opened PR #1. Repo restructured
  into `frontend/` + this tracking doc and `DESIGN.md` added at the request of the repo owner.
